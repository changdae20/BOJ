### 문제 설명

<p>Oipotato loves his girlfriend very much. Since Valentine’s Day is coming, he decided to buy some presents for her.</p>

<p>There are n presents in the shop, and Oipotato can choose to buy some of them. We know that his girlfriend will possibly feel extremely happy if she receives a present. Therefore, if Oipotato gives k presents to his girlfriend, she has k chances to feel extremely happy. However, Oipotato doesn’t want his girlfriend to feel extremely happy too many times for the gifts.</p>

<p>Formally, each present i will make Oipotato’s girlfriend feel extremely happy with probability P<sub>i</sub>. Oipotato now needs to decide what to buy in order to maximize the probability that his girlfriend feels extremely happy exactly once. Please help him find that maximum probability.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>There are multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:</p>

<p>The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000), indicating the number of possible presents.</p>

<p>The second line contains n real numbers P<sub>i</sub> (0 ≤ P<sub>i</sub> ≤ 1) given with exactly six digits after the decimal point, indicating the probability that Oipotato’s girlfriend feels extremely happy when receiving present i.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that the sum of n in all test cases does not exceed 500 000.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line with the answer. Your answer will be considered correct if and only if the absolute error of your answer is less than 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
